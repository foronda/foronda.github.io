My name is **Brylian Foronda**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am an alumni of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. I am currently an IT Professional at the Ka ªa as a Professional Engineer (P.E) to practice in the states of Texas, Massachusetts and California. I double majored in EECS and Mathematics during my undergraduate life at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/), and currently focusing on Electrical Engineering for my post-graduate studies.
