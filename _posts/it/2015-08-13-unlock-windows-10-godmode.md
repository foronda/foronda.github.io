### Windows 10 God Mode

Found this article at [^thinkcomputers.org] regarding some 'GodMode' configuration in Windows 10. Curious to what it was, I went ahead and unlocked it via an easy hack.

### Unlock God Mode You Ask?

##### Step 1: Create a new folder on your desktop

- Right Click on Desktop > New folder. You can also use the  ```CTRL+SHIFT+N``` keyboard shortcut to make a new folder.

##### Step 2: Rename the folder.

- Name this folder the following, 

```
GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}
``` 

Actually, you can name the string before the **.** anything you want. For example

```
HelloWorld.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}
```

##### Step 3: Open the new 'GodMode Shortcut'

- The folder icon is replaced by an icon similar to a Control Panel icon immediately after renaming.

While this may be a rather convenient shortcut, I do not see myself using it as a way of accessing windows configurations. Mainly because I have become accustomed to the Windows 8 Charms shortcuts (Win + Q, Win + X, etc..). With Charms, I have the ability to search and specific which controls I need to access. 

With Windows 10 being out for a couple of weeks now and given my role as an IT Manager, a tool that would be more beneficial the Remote Server Administration Tool (RSAT) for Windows 10. Microsoft, I am patiently waiting - having to remote into the domain controller to manage AD objects is so time consuming! :P
